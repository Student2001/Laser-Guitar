# Laser-Guitare
A laser guitar is a guitar of which the strings have been replaced by lasers and the frets by a touchpad.
In short, I will try to make a guitar with 4 lasers instead of 6 strings. The program will constantly read the laser receivers and when a laser is blocked it will send a transmission through the touchpad. This will read which fret was pushed, so it will know what tone to produce.
